These tools are used to generate a DGA dataset.

## PREREQUISITES
Download a copy of the DGA generation algorithms from https://github.com/baderj/domain_generation_algorithms.

## PROCESS
1. Run generate_dga_domains.py
2. Run get_benign_domains.py
3. Run make_dga_dataset.py
4. Run build_dga_model.py
* Command line syntax and examples are noted within each script.

## ADDITIONAL SCRIPTS
A. example_predict.py: Used to show how the DGA tool and model can be used to integrate into an existing workflow.
